You will also have to write a function to return answers from a pattern-action list.  There is a lot of work to accomplish in this assignment, but this portion is intended for you to write about what you accomplished.

## Reflection Questions
1. In your own words describe the `search_pa_list` function.

matches the sentence of a user to the sentences in pa list. If theres a match it calls on the corrrepsindgin function and return answer, if it find a match but the answer is nothing then it returns no answers and if it donst match any of the sentences then it returns it dosnt understand

2. What movie did you add to the `movies.py` file?  What year was it made? Any specific reason you added that movie?
I added black panther it was made in 2018. There isnt really any specifc reason it was just a good movie that came to mind

3. What pattern / action did you add to the paList data structure?  Why do you think that is a useful pattern / action?

I added a diffrent verson of the get acor one where instead you just put the name of thr actor and then ask what movie they acted so like chris hemsworht appear in what movies.I think this is useful as this is the way I would look up to see what movies an actor acted in

4. What is chatbot would you create that would be like this?  Describe why you would create it and what it would do.

A chatbot that I would create that would be similar to this is a chatbot that would take your input of a college so like what is urban ranked in enginnering, or avg gpa and sat for urbana studetns and stuff like that as I think it would be usefull to knwo this stuff and this would be a ez way to get info abou the colleges indtead of needing to go surfing the web for the answers
